After which, it will show you the fastest route - by Campus Blue, Campus Red or by walking. 

It also stores your most commonly inputted form fields and allows for an 'autofill' function.

This project incorporated our understanding of searching and sorting algorithms, data structures, as well as functional programming. It also challenged us to pick up something new, such as using Pygame for the GUI. Overall, it was an enriching first project. The hands-on nature made us much more comfortable with Python programming as well as project management.

Thanks to my groupmates Adithya and Darshini, we got an A for this project.
